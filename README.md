# handlebars-burger-app

## description
This app allows CRUD functions through API routes to interact with a database. The user can see all burgers in the database, add new burgers, remove burgers, and update them (setting boolean true or false only). 

[Test it out on heroku!](https://desolate-badlands-05368.herokuapp.com/)

## installation
On the user side, there is nothing to install since it is deployed on heroku. However, for the sake of knowledge here are the node packages used:
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)

## final thoughts
I built this app to practice CRUD capabilities with MySQL in a node express server. Because I used reference for the file structure, I'm not so sure I could confidently replicate this on my own but I'm going to try. 
The way that the code is structured modularizes functions really well and makes it more readable so I'd like to get more comfortable with that as well as understanding each line of the server set up better. I also want to explore handlebars more to see what else I can do with it since it seems extremely useful.
